# GRAPHICS_TURTLE_DESIGNS  

Welcome to the **Graphics Turtle Designs** repository! This project is a collection of various artistic designs created using the **Turtle graphics** library in Python. Turtle graphics is a popular way to introduce programming to kids and beginners by enabling them to create simple yet engaging graphical designs and patterns. This repository demonstrates how to use the Turtle library to create beautiful and intricate designs using basic programming concepts.
